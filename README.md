## Projects

1. Fraud Detection App

[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/tksluangrath/fraud-detection-app/tree/main)

Built a machine learning model and Streamlit app to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of **6.3M records**. Applied logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to identify fraud patterns, achieving **95% recall** on highly imbalanced data. The deployed app ingests transaction data and predicts fraud in real time.


**Skills:** Classification, Imbalanced Learning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, App Packaging  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, joblib
