## Projects

### 💳 Fraud Detection App


[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/tksluangrath/fraud-detection-app/tree/main)

Built a machine learning model and Streamlit app to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of **6.3M records**. Applied logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to identify fraud patterns, achieving **95% recall** on highly imbalanced data. The deployed app ingests transaction data and predicts fraud in real time.


**Skills:** Classification, Imbalanced Learning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, App Packaging  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, joblib

## ⚡ Energy Forecasting with XGBoost

[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/tksluangrath/energy-forecast-xgboost)

Forecasted hourly **electricity demand (MW)** for **American Electric Power (AEP)** using the XGBoost algorithm.  
Trained on 14 years of hourly data (2004–2018) with time-based feature engineering (hour, day, month).  
Achieved an **RMSE of 1644.39 MW** on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy for time-dependent data.

**Skills:** Time Series Forecasting, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib  

## 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulator Package

[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/tksluangrath/montecarlo)

Developed a custom **Python package** implementing a Monte Carlo simulation framework with three modular classes:  
**Die**, **Game**, and **Analyzer** — enabling users to roll weighted dice, simulate games, and analyze outcomes statistically.  
The package includes full **object-oriented design**, error handling, and unit tests, and can be installed directly via pip.

**Skills:** Object-Oriented Programming, Package Development, Simulation, Unit Testing  
**Tools:** Python, NumPy, pandas, Pytest, setuptools
