## Projects

### 💳 Fraud Detection App


[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/tksluangrath/fraud-detection-app/tree/main)

Built a machine learning model and Streamlit app to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of **6.3M records**. Applied logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to identify fraud patterns, achieving **95% recall** on highly imbalanced data. The deployed app ingests transaction data and predicts fraud in real time.


**Skills:** Classification, Imbalanced Learning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, App Packaging  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, joblib

## ⚡ Energy Forecasting with XGBoost

[🔗 View on GitHub](https://github.com/tksluangrath/energy-forecast-xgboost)

Forecasted hourly **electricity demand (MW)** for **American Electric Power (AEP)** using the XGBoost algorithm.  
Trained on 14 years of hourly data (2004–2018) with time-based feature engineering (hour, day, month).  
Achieved an **RMSE of 1644.39 MW** on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy for time-dependent data.

**Skills:** Time Series Forecasting, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib  

## 🧩 Haiti Disaster Relief: Identifying Blue Tarps from Aerial Imagery

[⬇️ Download Project Report (PDF)](./assets/docs/Haiti_Earthquake_Relief.pdf)

Developed machine learning models in **R** to identify **blue tarps** used by displaced residents after the Haiti earthquake from aerial imagery.  
Classified pixel level RGB data into *Blue Tarp* vs *Other* terrain to support disaster relief resource allocation. Addressed severe **class imbalance (≈3%)** and compared multiple classification algorithms, including LDA, QDA, KNN, Penalized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.  
The **penalized logistic regression** model achieved the best performance, correctly identifying 99% of blue tarp instances with minimal false positives, demonstrating high recall and robust generalization.

**Skills:** Data Preprocessing, Imbalanced Classification, Model Tuning, Threshold Optimization, ROC/AUC Analysis, Disaster Relief Analytics  
**Tools:** R, tidyverse, tidymodel, caret, themis (SMOTE), ggplot2
